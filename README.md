Knowledge nuggets on programming, web development, plugins, workflow optimizations, and the like. Here's my toolset:

- **Constantly:** MacBook Pro, Vim, git, Google, and Slack.
- **Mostly:** Filco Ninja mechanical keyboard with laptop stand & giant trackpad.
- **Often enough:** Rhodia dotpad and Uniball Signo UM-151 pens with .38 points. (You probably will not hear about them here, but they are my favorite.)
